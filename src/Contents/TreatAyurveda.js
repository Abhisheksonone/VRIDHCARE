              <p class="text-muted mb-4"><b>
              Depression and Anxiety are often observed to co-exist. Too much mental stress is a trigger that can result in mental disturbances leading to Depression or Anxiety. Stress is actually a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened. When you sense danger, whether it’s real or imagined, the body’s defense kicks into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the “fight-or-flight” reaction, or the stress response. However, excessive stress when left unmanaged can result in several illnesses including mental disorders such as Depression and Anxiety. Ayurvedic massage therapies are a 100% safe and proven treatment for such mental disorders.</b></p>

              Ageing is inevitable. It is a natural phenomenon and an intrinsic feature of life. As we age the body undergoes several physiological changes. Increasing age is associated with various illnesses including high blood pressure, diabetes, bone diseases, memory problems, etc. Ageing people also tend to show poor Mental Health which is of great concern. Disturbed Mental Health along with memory problems also increases risk of falls and injuries. Since ageing also reduces the strength of bone and makes them brittle, fractures at an old age are more difficult to treat.

Ayurvedic Classics believe that human body is meant to be shatayushi (live for 100 years) provided one follows the right daily regimens (Din Charyas) that include Abhayanga (Ayurvedic Body Massage), Diet and exercise. Failure to follow a healthy lifestyle leads to development of lifestyle disorders, the risk of which increases with age.</b></p>
